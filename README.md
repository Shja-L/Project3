# Project3(CS-210)

This project was built to analyze word frequency in a text-based dataset using C++. The goal was to provide an efficient way to process text and extract meaningful insights. Users can interact with a menu-driven system that lets them:

Check how often a specific word appears

Get an overall frequency count for all words

View a histogram to visualize word distribution

Save results to an output file for future reference

This project helped me refine my programming skills, particularly in designing a clear, functional, and maintainable program using industry best practices.

What Went Well.
One of my strengths in this project was successfully implementing all the required features while keeping the code organized and easy to read. I focused on writing clean, well-documented code with meaningful comments to make sure it was straightforward for others (and my future self) to understand.

Where I Could Improve
If I had more time, I would enhance the documentation by adding screenshots of the program’s output to make everything clearer. Additionally, I’d refine some parts of my code for better efficiency and security, such as optimizing how the program handles input and improving error detection.

Challenges I Faced
One of the biggest challenges was managing large datasets efficiently. Initially, the program struggled when processing a high volume of words, but I overcame this by improving the logic behind data handling and using more effective structures. Debugging and refining the algorithm helped a lot, and I leaned on online resources and instructor feedback to guide my approach.

Skills I Gained
This project helped me strengthen several programming concepts that will be useful in future courses and projects, including:

File handling and data manipulation

Algorithm design for text processing

Modular coding for scalability

Best practices for readable and well-organized code

Keeping the Code Maintainable
To ensure the program remains adaptable and easy to work with, I made sure to:

Write clear and concise comments to explain key parts of the code.

Use structured formatting to keep the logic easy to follow.

Apply a modular approach, breaking down functionality into smaller, reusable components.
